(optional) Make a custom filter that will show you all tasks.

Open up a list view for your custom filter (works with any list view really)

Open up the Developer Console (option+command+i on the Mac, Ctrl-Shift-i on windows).

Paste javascript code in js-files into the console and hit enter. The task-lines will now be in the clipboard (if successful)

Go into your favorite text editor and paste.
